# Overview

{This project demonstrates my implementation of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm using the R programming language. The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is a key Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique used to sample from complex probability distributions.}

{I developed this software to deepen my understanding of probabilistic simulation techniques and explore how statistical methods can be implemented and visualized in R. The project focuses on generating samples from a bivariate distribution that cannot be sampled directly and visualizing the results with density plots.}

{Through this implementation, Iâ€™ve gained experience in R syntax, data manipulation with tidyverse, custom function design, and effective data visualization. The final output includes CSV file handling, plotting of 2D density estimates, and statistical summaries.}
